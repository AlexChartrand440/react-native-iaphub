## Getting started

Implementing In-app purchases in your app should be a piece of cake!<br/>
This module implements the IAPHUB API on top of the [react-native-iap](https://github.com/dooboolab/react-native-iap) module üëè

1. Create an account on [IAPHUB](https://www.iaphub.com)

2. Install the package
``
npm install react-native-iaphub@latest --save
``

## Init
Call the `init` method at the start of your app to initialize your configuration<br/><br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è It should be called as soon as possible when starting your app.

```js
  await Iaphub.init({
    // The app id is available on the settings page of your app
    appId: "5e4890f6c61fc971cf46db4d",
    // The (client) api key is available on the settings page of your app
    apiKey: "SDp7aY220RtzZrsvRpp4BGFm6qZqNkNf",
    // App environment (production by default, other environments must be created on the IAPHUB dashboard)
    environment: "production"
  });
```

## Login
Call the `login` method to authenticate an user.<br/>

If you have an authentication system, provide the `user id` of the user right after the user log in.<br/>
If you don't and want to handle IAP on the client side, you can provide the `device id` when the app start instead by using a module such as [react-native-device-info](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-device-info#getuniqueid) to get a device unique ID.<br/>

‚ö† You should provide an id that is non-guessable and isn't public. (Email not allowed)
```js
await Iaphub.login("1e5494930c48ed07aa275fd2");
```

## Set user tags
Call the `setUserTags` method to update the user tags<br/><br/>
Tags are a powerful tool that allows you to offer to your users different products depending on custom properties.<br/>
‚ö† This method will throw an error if the tag name hasn't been created on the IAPHUB dashboard

```js
await Iaphub.setUserTags({gender: 'male'});
```

## Get user
Call the ``getUser`` method to fetch the user profile<br/><br/>
The user profile contains the active products (subscriptions not expired yet or non-consumables) and the products for sale of the user (the products the user is able to buy).

```js
var user = await Iaphub.getUser();

console.log(user);
{
  // The products the user is able to buy
  productsForSale: [
    {
      id: "5e5198930c48ed07aa275fd9",
      type: "renewable_subscription",
      sku: "membership2_tier10",
      groupName: "subscription_group_1",
      title: "Membership",
      description: "Become a member of the community",
      price: "$9.99",
      priceAmount: 9.99,
      priceCurrency: "USD",
      subscriptionPeriodType: "normal",
      subscriptionDuration: "P1M"
    },
    {
      id: "5e5198930c48ed07aa275fd9",
      type: "consumable",
      sku: "pack10_tier15",
      title: "Pack 10",
      description: "Pack of 10 coins",
      localizedPrice: "$14.99",
      price: 14.99,
      currency: "USD"
    }
  ],
  // The products the user bought that are still active (subscriptions or non-consumables)
  activeProducts: [{
    id: "5e5198930c48ed07aa275fd9",
    type: "renewable_subscription",
    sku: "membership1_tier5",
    purchase: "5e5198930c48ed07aa275fe8",
    purchaseDate: "2020-03-11T00:42:28.000Z",
    expirationDate: "2021-03-11T00:42:28.000Z",
    isSubscriptionRenewable: true,
    isSubscriptionRetryPeriod: false,
    groupName: "subscription_group_1",
    title: "Membership",
    description: "Become a member of the community",
    price: "$4.99",
    priceAmount: 4.99,
    priceCurrency: "USD",
    subscriptionDuration: "P1M",
    subscriptionPeriodType: "intro",
    subscriptionIntroPrice: "$1.99",
    subscriptionIntroPriceAmount: 1.99,
    subscriptionIntroPayment: "as_you_go",
    subscriptionIntroDuration: "P1M",
    subscriptionIntroCycles: 3
  }]
}
```

If an active subscription is available you should also check there is no retry period using the `isSubscriptionRetryPeriod` property.<br/>
If the subscription is in a retry period you should restrict the access to the features offered by your subscription and display a modal asking for the user to update its payment informations.

## Buy a product
Call the ``buy`` method to buy a product<br/><br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è The method needs the product sku that you would get from one of the products of the user productsForSale array.<br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è The method will process a purchase as a subscription replace if you currently have an active subscription and you buy a subscription of the same group (product group created on IAPHUB).<br/>
‚ö† Buying a product that isn't in the productsForSale array will throw an error.

```js
try {
  var transaction = await Iaphub.buy("pack10_tier15");
  console.log(transaction);
  {
    id: "2e5198930c48ed07aa275fd3",
    type: "consumable",
    sku: "pack10_tier15",
    purchase: "4e5198930c48ed07aa275fd2",
    purchaseDate: "2020-03-11T00:42:27.000Z",
    webhookStatus: "success",
    groupName: "pack",
    title: "Pack 10",
    description: "Pack of 10 coins",
    localizedPrice: "$14.99",
    price: 14.99,
    currency: "USD"
  }

  // To override the default proration mode on Android (https://developer.android.com/reference/com/android/billingclient/api/BillingFlowParams.ProrationMode):
  //var transaction = await Iaphub.buy("subscription_1", {androidProrationMode: 2});

  /*
   * The purchase has been successful but we need to check that the webhook to our server was successful as well
   * If the webhook request failed, IAPHUB will send you an alert and retry again in 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour and 24 hours.
   * You can retry the webhook directly from the dashboard as well
   */
  if (transaction.webhookStatus == "failed") {
    Alert.alert(
      "Purchase delayed",
      "Your purchase was successful but we need some more time to validate it, should arrive soon! Otherwise contact the support (support@myapp.com)"
    );
  }
  // Everything was successful! Yay!
  else {
    Alert.alert(
      "Purchase successful",
      "Your purchase has been processed successfully!"
    );
  }
} catch (err) {
  // Purchase popup cancelled by the user (ios only)
  if (err.code == "user_cancelled") return
  // Couldn't buy product because it has been bought in the past but hasn't been consumed (restore needed)
  else if (err.code == "product_already_owned") {
    Alert.alert(
      "Product already owned",
      "Please restore your purchases in order to fix that issue",
      [
        {text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel'},
        {text: 'Restore', onPress: () => Iaphub.restore()}
      ]
    );
  }
  /*
   * The receipt has been processed on IAPHUB but something went wrong
   * It is probably because of an issue with the configuration of your app or a call to the Itunes/GooglePlay API that failed
   * IAPHUB will send you an email notification when a receipt fails, by checking the receipt on the dashboard you'll find a detailed report of the error
   * After fixing the issue (if there's any), just click on the 'New report' button in order to process the receipt again
   * If it is an error contacting the Itunes/GooglePlay API, IAPHUB will retry to process the receipt automatically as well
   */
  else if (err.code == "receipt_validation_failed") {
    Alert.alert(
      "We're having trouble validating your transaction",
      "Give us some time, we'll retry to validate your transaction ASAP!"
    );
  }
  /*
   * The receipt hasn't been validated on IAPHUB (Could be an issue like a network error...)
   * The user will have to restore its purchases in order to validate the transaction
   * An automatic restore should be triggered on every relaunch of your app since the transaction hasn't been 'finished'
   * Android should automatically refund transactions that are not 'finished' after 3 days
   */
  else if (err.code == "receipt_request_failed") {
    Alert.alert(
      "We're having trouble validating your transaction",
      "Please try to restore your purchases later (Button in the settings) or contact the support (support@myapp.com)"
    );
  }
  // Couldn't buy product for many other reasons (the user shouldn't be charged)
  else {
    Alert.alert(
      "Purchase error",
      "We were not able to process your purchase, please try again later or contact the support (support@myapp.com)"
    );
  }
}
```

## Restore user purchases
Call the ``restore`` method to restore the user purchases<br/><br/>
This method will return the transactions that were not already saved on IAPHUB.<br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è You should display a restore button somewhere in your app (usually on the settings page).<br/>
‚ÑπÔ∏è If you logged in using the `device id`, an user using a new device will have to restore its purchases since the `device id` will be different.

```js
var restoredPurchases = await Iaphub.restore();

console.log(restoredPurchases);
[{
  id: "2e5198930c48ed07aa275fd1",
  type: "consumable",
  sku: "pack20_tier20",
  purchase: "ae5198930c48ed07aa275fdd",
  purchaseDate: "2020-01-11T00:42:27.000Z",
  webhookStatus: "success",
  groupName: "pack"
}]
```

## Logout
Call the `logout` method after an user log out<br/>

‚ÑπÔ∏è After a logout any purchase event will be saved in a queue until the user log in.<br>
‚ÑπÔ∏è Logout isn't required if you logged in with a `device id`.

```js
await Iaphub.logout();
```

## FAQ

### I'm already validating receipts on my server, can I run receipt validation on both `MY SERVER` and `IAPHUB`?
Yes! It can be pretty handy if you want to:
- Slowly migrate over IAPHUB
- Give IAPHUB a try without shutting down your current receipt validation system
- Implement a fallback system to validate receipts when an error occurs
- Run both systems in parallel

It's easy to implement by using the `onReceiptProcessed` event that is triggered after IAPHUB processed a receipt
```js
  await Iaphub.init({
    appId: "5e4890f6c61fc971cf46db4d",
    apiKey: "SDp7aY220RtzZrsvRpp4BGFm6qZqNkNf",
    environment: "production"
    /*
     * Event triggered after IAPHUB processed a receipt
     * @param {Object} err Error object if the receipt processing failed (otherwise null)
     * @param {Object} receipt - Receipt object
     * @param {String} receipt.sku - Product sku
     * @param {String} receipt.token - Receipt token
     * @param {Boolean} receipt.isRestore - If the event is triggered from a restore
     */
    onReceiptProcessed: async (err, receipt) => {
      console.log(receipt);
      {
        sku: "pack10_tier15",
        token: "dzw4d....sd",
        isRestore: false
      }
      /*
       * Send the receipt to yout server
       * If you want to override the transaction returned by the buy method, your server must return the new transactions of the receipt
       * Warning: Do not return the old transactions already processed!
       */
      var newTransactions = await fetch("https://api.myapp.com/receipt", {
        method: "POST",
        headers: {'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        body: JSON.stringify(receipt)
      });
      console.log(newTransactions);
      [{
        sku: "pack10_tier15"
      }]
      /*
       * If an array is returned by this function it'll override the receipt transactions returned by IAPHUB
       * For instance, below we only override the transactions if the receipt processing failed with an error
       * A transaction must contain at least the property 'sku' in order to identify the transaction that will be returned from the buy method
       */
      if (err) {
        return newTransactions;
      }
    }
  });
```
